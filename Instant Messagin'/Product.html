            Our product is a program that allows you to 
            message any phone from your computer as long 
            as you sign up for our service using your token id
            and authenitication from Twilio and know the phone number
            of the phone that you are messaging. It's simple, easy, and 
            best of all, free! Try it now for yourself to see if it fits
            your needs, wants, and vision for an application that can 
            text phones from just your computer. This API that we offer 
            isn't just something that you can find on the internet. Crafted 
            by our lead programmer, Maxx Tandon (in the python department), it allows
            one to send a bunch of spam messages to any person of their choice as 
            long as you have their phone number.</p>
