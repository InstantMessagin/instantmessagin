        <p>
           Our program uses python's SMTPLIB package in order to send messages. We have tweaked it to allow us to create multiple port sockets and change modifications of emails to send these messages to phones through WiFi and not personal data!

            Our main developer <strong>Maxx Tandon</strong> 
            created the program in which users can enter 
            in their SID's and Token's in order to access 
            the Twilio database and send messages from our
            website to any phone! Our code for the 
            automatic verification is in the making
            and will be available to major 
            companies/businesses soon!

            Our website base was built by mainly by our developer, <strong>David Teklea,</strong>
            in which our code was handmade and built to run all 
            of the pages and various sections of our code for you to interact with. It is here
            where the magic happens, where we do the trolling of the trolls, the greatest pranks 
            of pranks, where we send people troll messages just waiting to be clicked 
            on. And these messages are just any ol' messages. These messages come in hundreds,
            if not thousands of company pairs in which they will troll the living nightmare out
            of your soul.
